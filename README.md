This repository contains the data descriptors and selected analysis scripts for our study titled:

**"Shotgun metagenomic profiling of multi-kingdom salivary microbiome dynamics across periodontal health and disease stages"**

We performed deep shotgun metagenomic sequencing of saliva samples from 204 clinically examined participants representing six periodontal statesâ€”from health to severe periodontitis. The study characterizes bacterial, fungal, viral, and archaeal community shifts and identifies microbiome-based biomarkers for periodontal disease. 

Key findings include:
- Clear separation of microbial profiles across periodontal health and disease using beta diversity metrics.
- Enrichment of known periodontal pathogens (e.g., *P. gingivalis*, *T. forsythia*, *T. denticola*) in advanced stages.
- Detection of non-bacterial genera (e.g., *Candida*, *Moineavirus*, *Aspergillus*) as part of the salivary microbiome.
- High diagnostic accuracy of microbiome-based models in predicting disease stage.

The project is part of the SECRETO Oral study.
